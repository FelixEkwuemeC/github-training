What is GitHub?
---------------

GitHub is an online platform for collaborative projects that uses the Git version control system (VCS). GitHub allows users to utilize all of the features of Git without using command-line based programming. Users upload files to GitHub and then can share them with collaborators who can each work independently and merge in changes. GitHub (through Git) allows one to easily compare differences between files, all while keeping old versions archived. Moreover, one of the advantages of Git as compared with other VCS is the ability for users to work locally on files (without internet access) and only sync changes made when necessary. GitHub hosts a large number of open-sourced projects and also has a very active help community.
